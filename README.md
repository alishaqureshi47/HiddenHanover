## ‚ú® Learning Journey

### What inspired this project?

This app started as a way to document and share Dartmouth‚Äôs best-kept secrets ‚Äî the hidden benches, scenic turns, and quiet thinking spots that often go unnoticed. I wanted to create something that felt **personal**, **explorable**, and **immersive**.

### Potential Impact

This could evolve into a crowd-sourced community map where students and locals can add their own favorite spots. It could foster a deeper connection with the local landscape and build a digital memory of the town. Future ideas include a mood tracker, journaling prompts for locations, or community playlists.

### New Technologies Learned

* **Mapbox GL JS** ‚Äî For dynamic, fully interactive maps
* **WeatherAPI Forecast API** ‚Äî For fetching and displaying structured weather data
* **React State Management & Effects** ‚Äî For dynamic UI updates and asynchronous data

### Why These Tools?

* **Mapbox** gave me complete control over styling and interactivity ‚Äî more flexible than Google Maps.
* **WeatherAPI** provided simpler, cleaner forecast data compared to OpenWeather.
* **React** allowed me to modularize the map, weather, and layout components cleanly.

### Challenges & Lessons

* Getting Mapbox to display markers and popups the way I wanted took some trial and error.
* Styling the weather forecast to look compact and scrollable (but not overflow the page) took lots of CSS tweaking.
* Initially used OpenWeatherMap but switched due to inconsistent results ‚Äî learned the value of choosing the right API early.
* Making sure the weather bar didn't break layout taught me a lot about Flexbox and overflow handling.

## Things left to do

* Add location submission functionality so users can suggest their own hidden gems.
* Build a backend using Firebase to store locations dynamically.
* Enable login and user-specific playlists or journal notes.
